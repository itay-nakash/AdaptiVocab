# AdaptiVocab
This repository presents AdaptiVocab, a vocabulary-centric method for adapting LLMs to domain-specific tasks. By modifying the tokenizer and embedding layers, AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by over 25% without compromising performance. The code includes modules for vocabulary optimization, embedding initialization, and lightweight fine-tuning.
